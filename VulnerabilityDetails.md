### Summary
A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. All the information we have so far is included in this page.

### Impact
* An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system.
* This flaw allows an attacker with a local system account to modify on-disk binaries, bypassing the standard permission mechanisms that would prevent modification without an appropriate permission set. 

### How
* The In The Wild exploit relied on writing to /self/proc/mem on one side of the race.
* The In The Wild exploit relied on using ptrace.
* The attack relies on racing the madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) system call while having the page of the executable mmapped in memory.
